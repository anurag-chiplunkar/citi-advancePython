Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a powerful programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, each representing a real-world entity with its own attributes (data) and behaviors (functions or methods). Python is a versatile and expressive language that fully supports OOP principles.

Key Concepts in OOP:

Class: A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the attributes and methods that all instances (objects) of that class will have. Classes are the foundation of OOP and allow us to create custom data types.

Object: An object is an instance of a class. It represents a specific entity based on the class's blueprint, with its own unique data and behavior. Each object has its own state (values of attributes) and can perform actions defined by the class's methods.

Attributes: Attributes are variables that hold data specific to each object. They represent the characteristics or properties of an object and are defined within the class.

Methods: Methods are functions defined within a class that perform actions or computations on the object's data. They define the behavior of the object and how it interacts with other objects.

Inheritance: Inheritance is a fundamental concept in OOP that allows a class (subclass) to inherit attributes and methods from another class (superclass). It enables code reuse and promotes the creation of a hierarchy of related classes.

Encapsulation: Encapsulation is the principle of bundling data and methods together within a class, hiding the internal details and exposing only necessary functionalities. It helps in data protection and maintaining the class's integrity.

Polymorphism: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. It enables flexibility and interchangeability of objects, allowing them to respond differently to the same method calls.
